This page explores the possibility of fitting a compartmental model for the propagation of COVID-19 in France, to predict the number of deaths after the lockdown ends.

In the first part, the concept of compartmental models is quickly presented through one of the most simple model: the SIR model. Then, the more advanced model used here is described. In the second part, the model is fitted to real data, and its predictions are presented. Finally, the third part aims to provide an adjusted model according to newly available data.

Data is gathered from the <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins Github repository</a>. The code is maintained on <a href="https://github.com/stephanefevrier/covid-19-analysis" target="_blank">this repository</a>, made with Python on a Jupyter notebook.


# Part 1: Compartmental models

This first part quickly explains the concept of compartmental models and describes the model used with its equations.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology" target="_blank">Compartmental models</a> are a simple way to model the spread of infectious diseases by separating the population into several meaningful compartments. One of the simplest example of a compartmental model is the SIR model.

## Quick introduction: SIR model

The SIR model consists of 3 compartments: **S**usceptible, **I**nfectious, and **R**ecovered. Each compartment is described by a time-dependent variable $$S(t), I(t), R(t)$$, representing the number of people in it.

This deterministic model can be expressed by the following set of ordinary differential equations:

$$\frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta \cdot I \cdot \frac{S}{N}$$ 

$$\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta \cdot I \cdot \frac{S}{N} - \gamma \cdot I$$

$$\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma \cdot I$$ 

<!--

- $$\frac{dS}{dt}$$: $$I$$ infectious people can infect a proportion of $$S/N$$ people, each decreasing the $$S$$ population by $$\beta$$.
- $$\frac{dI}{dt}$$: The population going out of $$S$$ comes to $$I$$ (previous equation, opposite sign). Also, $$I$$ people recover at a rate of $$\gamma$$.
- $$\frac{dR}{dt}$$: The population going out of $$I$$ comes to $$R$$ (second term of previous equation, opposite sign).

-->

The equations are solved using the initial conditions, along with the following set of parameters:

- $$N$$: total population
- $$\beta$$: expected amount of people an infectious person infects per day (probability for an infectious person to infect a healthy person $$\times$$ average number of contact per day)
- $$\gamma$$: rate of recovery, or proportion of infectious recovering per day (inverse of the number of days that an infectious person has and can spread the disease)
- $$R_0 = \beta / \gamma$$: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number" target="_blank">basic reproduction number</a>, expected total number of people an infectious person infects.


## Advanced compartmental model: SEICRD model

In an attempt to describe more complex dynamics, the last model is expanded and the following compartments are used: 

- **S**usceptible (no exposition to the disease)
- **E**xposed (carrying the disease without symptoms, not infectious)
- **I**nfectious (carrying the disease and being infectious)
- **C**ritical (carrying the disease, critically ill, being at hospital)
- **R**ecovered (had the disease, recovered and immune to it)
- **D**ead (had the disease, died of it)


The $$R_0$$ is time-dependent, and the number of available ICU beds ($$b$$) is taken into account: if the number of *Critical* people is above the number of available ICU beds, anyone without bed goes to the *Dead* compartment. This SEICRD model is a modification of the one presentend in <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/infectious-disease-modelling-fit-your-model-to-coronavirus-data-2568e672dbc7" target="_blank">this article</a>. The general logic is maintained, making it possible to read the full article to better understand the model briefly described below.

### Equations

The SEICRD system can be expressed by the following set of ordinary differential equations:

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta(t) \cdot I \cdot \frac{S}{N}
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dE}{dt} = \beta(t) \cdot I \cdot \frac{S}{N} - \delta \cdot E
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dI}{dt} = \delta \cdot E - \frac{1}{12} \cdot p(I→C) \cdot I - \gamma \cdot (1 - p(I→C)) \cdot I
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dC}{dt} = \frac{1}{12} \cdot p(I→C) \cdot I - \frac{1}{7.5} \cdot p(C→D) \cdot min(b,C) - max(0,C-b) - \frac{1}{6.5} \cdot (1-p(C→D)) \cdot min(b,C)
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma \cdot (1-p(I→C)) \cdot I + \frac{1}{6.5} \cdot (1-p(C→D)) \cdot min(b,C)
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{dD}{dt} = \frac{1}{7.5} \cdot p(C→D) \cdot min(b,C) + max(0,C-b)
\end{equation}
$$

### Time-dependent variables

It can be noted that $$\beta(t)$$ is time-dependent: it is calculated from $$R_0(t)$$, which varies through time, taking into account the effect of a lockdown for example. A logistic function is used to describe $$R_0(t)$$ before and during lockdown:
 
$$ R_0(t) = \frac{R_0 start - R_0 end}{1 + e^{-k(-x + x_0)}} + R_0 end $$

The number of available ICU beds is supposed to be constant.

### Parameters

The equations are solved using the initial conditions ($$S_0 = N-1$$, $$E_0 = 1$$, $$I_0 = 0$$, $$C_0 = 0$$, $$R_0 = 0$$, $$D_0 = 0$$), along with the following set of parameters:

- $$N$$: total population 
- $$\beta(t)$$: expected amount of people an infectious person infects per day
- $$\gamma$$: rate of infectious recovering per day
- $$\delta$$: rate of exposed getting infectious per day (inverse of incubation period)
- $$p(I→C)$$: probability of going to ICU (from infectious to critical)
- $$p(C→D)$$: probability of dying at ICU (from critical to dead) 
- $$b$$: number of ICU beds available 
- $$R_0start$$: initial value of $$R_0(t)$$ 
- $$R_0end$$: final value of $$R_0(t)$$ 
- $$x_0$$: inflection point of $$R_0(t)$$ (equivalent of lockdown day)
- $$k$$: steepness of $$R_0(t)$$

# Part 2: Predicting the number of deaths in France

As the model has been described, the objective is now to use it to make a prediction about the evolution of the situation in France. 

## Hypotheses and limitations

A model never fully reflects reality, but can be helpful if its limitations are known. In this case, the following hypotheses and limitations need to be considered: 

- The total population is constant: $$S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + C(t) + R(t) + D(t) = N $$, $$\forall t$$. 
- Deaths do not change the population structure (age groups proportions). Vital dynamics such as birth and nutural death are not taken into account.
- The population is assumed to act homogeneously (described in average).
- The number of beds only impacts the critical cases, which are taken care of at hospital. All critical patients that do not get treatment (ICU bed) die.
- Individuals are immune after recovering.
- The system is extremely sensitive to initial conditions and parameters: a slight change can lead to completely different outcomes.

## Fixed parameters: data used

In order to lower the degrees of freedom during the fitting process, multiple parameters are set based on various estimations. However, it must be remembered that the data is incomplete and the measurement is inconsistent between countries. 

As seen in the equations, the rate of becoming critically ill is set as $$1/12$$, the rate of dying is set at $$1/7.5$$, and the rate of recovering while being critically ill is set at $$1/6.5$$. The rate of getting infectious is estimated at $$\delta = 1/3$$, and the rate of recovering while being infectious is set at $$\gamma = 1/9$$.

The number of beds is 7569.58, calculated from the number of beds per a hundred thousand inhabitants. It is constant, although it actually increased during the studied period.

The lockdown starts at March 17 ($$x_0$$) and end at May 11. $$R_0(t)$$ is logistic until the lockdown ends. After, it is set at 1.1 to emulate the effect of a French population going out of lockdown.

Finally, the population repartition by age group for France is known, along with an estimate of the probability of going to ICU and of dying at ICU, per age group (see below). To include this data to the model, a weighted sum is used:

- global probability of going to ICU $$p(I→C ) = 4.1\%$$
- global probability of dying at ICU $$p(C→D) = 26.2\%$$

## Parameters to fit 

Three remaining parameters need to be fitted: $$R_0start$$, $$R_0end$$, and $$k$$. Estimations give $$R_0$$ close to 3.6 before lockdown and around 0.7 during lockdown. As a result, these will be the initial values given respectively to $$R_0start$$ and $$R_0end$$ at the beginning of the fitting process, while variations are allowed.

The remaining parameter $$k$$ corresponding to the steepness of the logistic curve is set to be below 5.

## Data used for the fitting

The number of deaths is supposed to be the closest to reality, compared to the number of confirmed and recovered cases. As a consequence, it is used to fit the data. 

The $$D$$ compartment is supposed to fit the estimated number of deaths, so another parameter needs to be considered: the outbreak shift. Available data starts at January 22, but the initial conditions given to the model can correspond to a different date. The outbreak shift allows to set a different starting date. Being an integer, the optimization process is done separately from the fitting. Best results are observed with an outbreak shift of 26 days, meaning that the first case in France is supposed to be on December 27, 2019. 

## Fitted model

The fitting process is done using <a href="https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/" target="_blank">LMFIT</a>, a Non-Linear Least-Squares Minimization module for Python. The first plot shows the fitted curve ($$D$$) against real data. The fitting residuals are evenly spread, with the exception of the increasing curve's beginning (around March 20). The other compartments can be displayed by clicking on the legend.

An important result is the number of deaths predicted at lockdown end: **27,236**. The fitted curve is extended until June 10, with a prediction of **33,104** deaths. As the model is extremely sensitive, no projection is made further in time.

The next plot shows the evolution of the $$R_0$$. Fitted parameters: $$R_0start =  3.80$$, $$R_0end = 0.69$$, $$k = 0.14$$. The initial $$R_0$$ is higher than the estimation of 3.6, while the final $$R_0$$ corresponds to the 0.7 estimate.

It can be noted that $$k$$ is close to 0, resulting in a low steepness. $$R_0$$ starts to decrease before the lockdown beginning, and is already down to 2.35 when the lockdown starts. This low steepness eases the optimization process and smoothes $$R_0$$, which can be interpreted only as an average evolution.
Finally, $$R_0 = 1.1$$ instantly after lockdown, as parametrized before.

-->

The last plot shows the number of daily deaths fitted against real data. A spike of deaths is observed around March 29, corresponding to an ICU over capacity for the model. As it looks to fit well the data, it may also be an overfit. People directly dying because of a lack of ICU beds is a naive approach, but it helps to simplify more complex phenomenons. 

After lockdown, the estimated number of daily deaths is around **190-230**, which is high but coincides with the $$R_0 = 1.1$$ scenario.

## Conclusion

While the model predictions *look* good (it's beautiful), several aspects needs to be considered:

- The approach used here is naive, but can be a useful macroscopic first approximation. 
- The compartments could be adjusted with new knowledge about the disease (e.g. if there is an acquired immunity, how long does it last)
- The ICU beds implementation could be more accurate by increasing the number of beds through time accordingly to real data.
- The $$R_0$$ after lockdown is set at 1.1 to emulate a specific scenario, but could be updated when the first post-lockdown-$$R_0$$ estimations are given.
- The outbreak shift may be set to an earlier date, but . This would however mean a lower $$R_0$$
- Multiple parameters need to be adjusted with new data. Notably, $$\gamma$$ and $$\delta$$ should be re-estimated, along with the probability of going to ICU and the probability of dying at ICU.

# Part 3: Adjusting the model with new data

As new data is available everyday, it is interesting to assess the model performances and to possibly adjust it. 

## Update 1: data from May 11

The initial model made a prediction of **27,236** deaths on May 11, and the actual number of deaths is at **26,646**. While it is a small 2.2% error, this prediction was only 12 days far from the last available data.

### Adjusted model

A new fitted model is proposed below, with slightly more freedom for the values. Fitted parameters: $$R_0start =  3.84$$, $$R_0end = 0.61$$, $$k = 0.12$$. 

While the model fits better the new data, the number of deaths still seems over-estimated. The prediction of the number of deaths on June 10 is now at **31,863**, which is a 4% descrease compared to the initial model. After lockdown, the estimated number of daily deaths is around **160-200**.

## Update 2: added degrees of freedom

In this model update, multiple parameters that were fixed are allowed to vary:
- $$R_0$$ after lockdown 
- Probability of going to ICU
- Probability of dying at ICU

While it is interesting to see the model reaction to an increase in the degrees of freedom, the best fit may be obtained by a combination of parameters actually far from reality. The results should in consequence be taken with caution, even with the freedom given to the parameters is limited.

### Adjusted model

Fitted parameters: $$R_0start =  3.84$$, $$R_0end = 0.61$$, $$k = 0.12$$, $$R_0 = 1.20$$ after lockdown, probability of going to ICU: 3.65%, probability of dying at ICU: 20.98%.

New data should be used to better estimate the $$R_0$$ after lockdown.
