This page provides several interactive visualizations about the COVID-19. Data is gathered from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset), coming from the [Johns Hopkins Github repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). The code is maintained on [this repository](https://github.com/stephanefevrier/covid-19-analysis).

# Compartmental model: SEICRD

BUILDING #

- **S**usceptible - **E**xposed - **I**nfectious - **C**ritical - **R**ecovered - **D**ead
- Prediction of cases growth until 11 may for France
- Fitted $$R_0$$ on number of deaths for accuracy
- Need to constrain less on $$\gamma$$ and $$\delta$$

## Model Summary


$$\frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta \cdot I \cdot \frac{S}{N}$$ 

$$\frac{dE}{dt} = \beta \cdot I \cdot \frac{S}{N} - \delta \cdot E$$ 

$$\frac{dI}{dt} = \delta \cdot E - \frac{1}{12} \cdot p(I→C) \cdot I - \gamma \cdot (1 - p(I→C)) \cdot I$$ 

$$\frac{dC}{dt} = \frac{1}{12} \cdot p(I→C) \cdot I - \frac{1}{7.5} \cdot p(C→D) \cdot min(Beds(t),C) - max(0,C-Beds(t)) - \frac{1}{6.5} \cdot (1-p(C→D)) \cdot min(Beds(t),C)$$ 

$$\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma \cdot (1-p(I→C)) \cdot I + \frac{1}{6.5} \cdot (1-p(C→D)) \cdot min(Beds(t),C)$$ 

$$\frac{dD}{dt} = \frac{1}{7.5} \cdot p(C→D) \cdot min(Beds(t),C) + max(0,C-Beds(t))$$

Explanation:

- $$\frac{dS}{dt}$$: $$I$$ infected people can infect $$S/N$$ people at a rate of $$\beta$$.


- $$\frac{dE}{dt}$$: The population going out of $$S$$ comes to $$E$$ and becomes exposed (previous equation, opposite sign), as they have contracted the disease but no symptom at the moment. Exposed people $$E$$ get infectious at a rate of $$\delta$$.


- $$\frac{dI}{dt}$$: The population going out of $$E$$ comes to $$I$$ and becomes Infected (second term of previous equation, opposite sign), showing sign of the diseases and being able to infect other people. A proportion $$p(I→C)$$ of $$I$$ people get critically ill at a rate of $$1/12$$, and a proportion $$1 - p(I→C)$$ of $$I$$ people recover at a rate of $$\gamma$$.

- $$\frac{dC}{dt}$$: A proportion of $$p(I→C)$$ people going out of $$I$$ comes to $$C$$ at a rate of $$1/12$$ (second term of previous equation, opposite sign). A proportion $$p(C→D)$$ of $$min(Beds(t),C)$$ people dies and go to $$D$$ at a rate of $$1/7.5$$; 100% of $$max(0,C-Beds(t))$$ people go to $$D$$ and die due to bed shortage; a proportion $$1-p(C→D)$$ of $$min(Beds(t),C)$$ people recovers and go to $$R$$ at a rate of $$1/6.5$$.


- $$\frac{dR}{dt}$$: A proportion of $$1-p(I→C)$$ people going out of $$I$$ comes to $$R$$ at a rate of $$\gamma$$ (second term of infected equation, opposite sign). A proportion $$1-p(C→D)$$ of $$min(Beds(t),C)$$ people goint out of $$C$$ comes to $$R$$ at a rate of $$1/6.5$$ (fourth term of previous equation, opposite sign).

- $$\frac{dD}{dt}$$: A proportion of $$p(C→D)$$ people going out of $$C$$ goes to $$D$$ at a rate of $$1/7.5$$ (second term of critical equation, opposite sign). All $$max(0,C-Beds(t))$$ people going out of $$C$$ go to $$D$$ and die due to bed shortage (third term of critical equation, opposite sign.



## Time-dependent variables

In this model we use 2 time-dependent variables: $$R_0(t)$$ and $$Beds(t)$$.

- Using the same logistic function for $$R_0(t)$$:
$$ R_0(t) = \frac{R_0 start - R_0 end}{1 + e^{-k(-x + x_0)}} + R_0 end $$

- For beds, hypothesis is that the number will grow as countries try to react to bed shortage:
$$ Beds(t) = Beds_0 + s \cdot t \cdot Beds_0 $$

with $$Beds_0$$ the initial number of beds and $$s$$ a scaling factor.
