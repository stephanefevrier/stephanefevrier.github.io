This page explores the possibility of fitting a compartmental model for the propagation of COVID-19 in France, making a projection until after the nation-wide containment end. 

The first part explains the concept of compartmental models and describes the equations used, while the second part shows the data used, the fitted model and its results.

Data is gathered from the <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins Github repository</a> and <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>. The code is maintained on <a href="https://github.com/stephanefevrier/covid-19-analysis" target="_blank">this repository</a>, made with Python on a Jupyter notebook.


# Compartmental models

This first part quickly explains the concept of compartmental models and describes the equations used for the model.

Compartmental models are a simple way to model the spread of infectious diseases by separating the population into several meaningful compartments. One of the simplest example of a compartmental model is the SIR model, which is explained below to introduce the concept of compartmental models before showing the actual model used here.

## Quick introduction: SIR model

The SIR model, deterministic and based on ordinary differential equations, consists of 3 compartments: Susceptible ($$S$$), Infectious ($$I$$), and $$R$$ (Recovered). 

### Compartments

Each variable ($$S$$, $$I$$, $$R$$) represents the number of people in the associated compartment and depends on time:

- $$S(t)$$: number of susceptible people on day $$t$$ (no exposition to the disease)
- $$I(t)$$: number of infectious people on day $$t$$ (carrying the disease and being infectious)
- $$R(t)$$: number of recovered people on day $$t$$ (had the disease, being immune or dead)

### Equations

The SIR system can be expressed by the following set of ordinary differential equations:

$$\frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta \cdot I \cdot \frac{S}{N}$$ 

$$\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta \cdot I \cdot \frac{S}{N} - \gamma \cdot I$$

$$\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma \cdot I$$ 

- $$\frac{dS}{dt}$$: $$I$$ infectious people can infect a proportion of $$S/N$$ people, each decreasing the $$S$$ population by $$\beta$$.
- $$\frac{dI}{dt}$$: The population going out of $$S$$ comes to $$I$$ (previous equation, opposite sign). Also, $$I$$ people recover at a rate of $$\gamma$$.
- $$\frac{dR}{dt}$$: The population going out of $$I$$ comes to $$R$$ (second term of previous equation, opposite sign).

### Parameters

The equations are solved using the initial conditions ($$S_0$$, $$I_0$$, $$R_0$$), along with the following set of parameters:

- $$N$$: total population
- $$\beta$$: expected amount of people an infectious person infects per day (probability of an infectious person to infect a healthy person $$\times$$ average number of people a person is in contact with per day)
- $$\gamma$$: rate of recovery,  or proportion of infectious recovering per day (inverse of number of days that an infectious person has and can spread the disease)
- $$R_0 = \beta / \gamma$$: basic reproduction number, expected total number of people an infectious person infects.


## Advanced compartmental model: SEICRD model

To be closer to reality, more compartments can be added and the relationship between each of them can be adjusted. Taking into account the specificities of COVID-19, a more advanced comportmental model (SEICRD) is built. It is a modification of the one presentend in <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/infectious-disease-modelling-fit-your-model-to-coronavirus-data-2568e672dbc7" target="_blank">this article</a>.

The SEICRD model consists of 5 compartments: Susceptible ($$S$$), Exposed ($$S$$), Infectious ($$I$$), Critical ($$C$$), $$R$$ (Recovered), and Dead ($$D$$). 

### Compartments

Each variable ($$S$$, $$E$$, $$I$$, $$C$$, $R$$, $$D$$) represents the number of people in the associated compartment and depends on time:

- $$S(t)$$: number of susceptible people on day $$t$$ (no exposition to the disease)
- $$E(t)$$: number of exposed people on day $$t$$ (carrying the disease without symptoms, not infectious)
- $$I(t)$$: number of infectious people on day $$t$$ (carrying the disease and being infectious)
- $$C(t)$$: number of critical people on day $$t$$ (carrying the disease, critically ill, being at hospital)
- $$R(t)$$: number of recovered people on day $$t$$ (had the disease, recovered and immune to it)
- $$D(t)$$: number of dead people on day $$t$$ (had the disease, died of it)

### Equations

The SEICRD system can be expressed by the following set of ordinary differential equations:

$$\frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta(t) \cdot I \cdot \frac{S}{N}$$ 

$$\frac{dE}{dt} = \beta(t) \cdot I \cdot \frac{S}{N} - \delta \cdot E$$ 

$$\frac{dI}{dt} = \delta \cdot E - \frac{1}{12} \cdot p(I→C) \cdot I - \gamma \cdot (1 - p(I→C)) \cdot I$$ 

$$\frac{dC}{dt} = \frac{1}{12} \cdot p(I→C) \cdot I - \frac{1}{7.5} \cdot p(C→D) \cdot min(Beds,C) - max(0,C-Beds) - \frac{1}{6.5} \cdot (1-p(C→D)) \cdot min(Beds,C)$$ 

$$\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma \cdot (1-p(I→C)) \cdot I + \frac{1}{6.5} \cdot (1-p(C→D)) \cdot min(Beds,C)$$ 

$$\frac{dD}{dt} = \frac{1}{7.5} \cdot p(C→D) \cdot min(Beds,C) + max(0,C-Beds)$$ 


Which can be explained as follows:

- $$\frac{dS}{dt}$$: $$I$$ infectious people can infect $$S/N$$ people at a rate of $$\beta$$.

- $$\frac{dE}{dt}$$: The population going out of $$S$$ comes to $$E$$ (previous equation, opposite sign). Exposed people $$E$$ get infectious at a rate of $$\delta$$.

- $$\frac{dI}{dt}$$: The population going out of $$E$$ comes to $$I$$. A proportion $$p(I→C)$$ of $$I$$ people get critically ill and goes to $$C$$ at a rate of $$1/12$$, and a proportion $$1 - p(I→C)$$ of $$I$$ people recover and goes to $$R$$ at a rate of $$\gamma$$.

- $$\frac{dC}{dt}$$: A proportion of $$p(I→C)$$ people going out of $$I$$ comes to $$C$$ at a rate of $$1/12$$. A proportion $$p(C→D)$$ of $$min(Beds(t),C)$$ people dies and goes to $$D$$ at a rate of $$1/7.5$$; All $$max(0,C-Beds(t))$$ people go to $$D$$ and die due to bed shortage; a proportion $$1-p(C→D)$$ of $$min(Beds(t),C)$$ people recovers and goes to $$R$$ at a rate of $$1/6.5$$.

- $$\frac{dR}{dt}$$: A proportion of $$1-p(I→C)$$ people going out of $$I$$ comes to $$R$$ at a rate of $$\gamma$$. A proportion $$1-p(C→D)$$ of $$min(Beds(t),C)$$ people goint out of $$C$$ comes to $$R$$ at a rate of $$1/6.5$$ (fourth term of previous equation, opposite sign).

- $$\frac{dD}{dt}$$: A proportion of $$p(C→D)$$ people going out of $$C$$ goes to $$D$$ at a rate of $$1/7.5$$. All $$max(0,C-Beds(t))$$ people going out of $$C$$ go to $$D$$ and die due to bed shortage.

### Time dependent variables

It can be noted in the previous equations that $$\beta(t)$$ is time-dependent: it depends on $$R_0(t)$$, which is supposed to be varying through time, taking into account the effect of a lockdown for example. A logistic function is used to describe $$R_0(t)$$:
 
$$ R_0(t) = \frac{R_0 start - R_0 end}{1 + e^{-k(-x + x_0)}} + R_0 end $$

### Parameters

The equations are solved using the initial conditions ($$S_0$$, $$E_0$$, $$I_0$$, $$C_0$$, $$R_0$$, $$D_0$$), along with the following set of parameters:

- $$N$$: total population 
- $$\beta(t)$$: expected amount of people an infectious person infects per day
- $$\gamma$$: rate of infectious recovering per day
- $$\delta$$: rate of exposed getting infectious per day (inverse of incubation period)
- $$p(I→C)$$: probability of going from infectious to critical 
- $$p(C→D)$$: probability of dying while critical 
- $$Beds$$: number of ICU beds available 
- $$R_0start$$: initial value of $$R_0(t)$$ 
- $$R_0end$$: final value of $$R_0(t)$$ 
- $$x_0$$: inflection point of $$R_0(t)$$ (equivalent of lockdown day)
- $$k$$: steepness of $$R_0(t)$$

# Model fitting

In this second part, limitations of the model are exposed before describing the data used and presenting the fitted model results.

## Hypotheses and limitations

A model is helpful to gain some insight, but never reflects reality. It is always bounded to a set of hypotheses, thus imposing limitations. The following needs to be considered before interpreting the model's results:

- The total population is constant: $$S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + C(t) + R(t) + D(t) = N$$. 
- Deaths do not change the population structure (age groups proportions). Vital dynamics such as birth and nutural death are not taken into account.
- The population is assumed to act homogeneously, as it is described in average.
- The number of beds only impacts the critical cases, which are taken care of at hospital. All critical patients that do not get treatment die.
- Individuals are immune after recovering.
- The system is extremely sensitive to initial conditions and parameters. It can be considered chaotic, as a slight change can lead to completely different outcomes.

## Data used

To lower the degrees of freedom during fitting, multiple parameters are set based on various estimates. However, it must be kept in mind that data is incomplete and the measurement is inconsistent between countries.

As seen in the equations, the rate of becoming critically ill is set as $$1/12$$, the rate of dying is set at $$1/7.5$$, and the rate of recovering while being critically ill is set at $$1/6.5$$.

The rate of getting infectious is estimated at $$\delta = 1/3$$, and the rate of recovering while being infectious is set at $$\gamma = 1/9$$.

The number of beds is 7569.58 (calculated from the number of beds per a hundred thousand inhabitants). 

The lockdown day ($$x_0$$) is set to coincide with the real date (March 17). The logistic evolution of $$R_0(t)$$ is true only during and before the lockdown. At the end of it (May 11), it is set a 1.1 to be close to the effect of a French population going out of lockdown.

Finally, the population repartition by age group for France is known, along with an estimate of the global probability of going to ICU per age group and of dying at ICU per age group (see below).


<iframe width="100%" height="750" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~stephanefevrier/298.embed?showlink=false"></iframe>

By linearly combining them, we get:

- probability of going to ICU $$p(I→C ) = 4.1\%$$
- probability of dying at ICU $$p(C→D) = 26.2\%$$

## Parameters to fit 

$$R_0start$$, $$k$$, and $$R_0end$$ need to be fitted. The $$R_0$$ is estimated at 3.6 before lockdown and 0.7 during lockdown. The associated parameters are constrained to be around these values. $$k$$ is able to go from 0 to 5 to let the fitting process breath a bit. A really progressive R_0 (so with k close to 0) seems to be giving better results, averaging the random spikes happening in the $$R_0$$. *ça lisse la courbe*

## Wait wait, what to fit on?

We know what parameters to use, what parameters to fit. Now we need to define a function to fit. Data is bad. Confirmed cases are really far from reality, recovered cases is about the same. Deaths cases seems to be the closest one to reality, as it generally happens in hospital and is documented. 

The counting can still influence the numbers. For example, when does someone dying counts as dead of covid-19? Just by having it? or needs to be proven?
But anyway, it is the best one, even if still not exact (like basically all data).

So we fit on nb of deaths, using lmfit, a Non-Linear Least-Squares Minimization module for Python.

+ note on outbreak:  26 days of outbreak shift is hypothesed, meaning that the first case is supposed to be on 22/01 - 26 days. Model starts with 1 I and all 0

## Fitted model

Need to remember: extremely sensitive to parameters choice

CLick the legend to see the other compartments, use log to bobobob.

Fitting residuals can be displayed. Except at the first curve, the points are basically oscillating randomly around the best fit, which is good.
data fits pretty well

The $$R_0$$ is going down really smoothly (k=ffzefef), from 3.6 to 0.7. As said before, the R_0 after lockdown is set to 1.1.

- after quarantine, the $$R_0$$ hypothesed to go up to 1.1 will let a constant number of people to die everyday.

-->

The interpretation of the number of people dying litteraly because they have no bed is a bit too much, but it actually models the reality quite good.

We have a nice bell, and after lockdown the nb of dead/day is of almost 200 per day. Which is high. But it is to see what will happen if social distancing is not really taken care of.

# Conclusions on the results

dunno

# To go further

- need to re estimate parameters (gamma and delta, nb of beds)
