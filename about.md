# Presentation

My name is Stéphane Février, I am a **Data Scientist** with a double master's degree in **Mechanical Engineering**. During my studies in France and Italy, I stepped into data science because of my deep interest in Artifical Intelligence. This led me to start learning on my own about how Machine Learning and Deep Learning work, before starting to apply this knowledge to real problems. I am now about to start a PhD at the crossroads between Deep Learning, Vibration Analysis and Predictive Maintenance. 

# The website

Made to showcase some interesting projects, this website can be seen as a technical and scientific demonstrator. The objective is to produce engaging and user-friendly data visualizations, along with the ability to play with model's parameters and directly see the effects on the predictions.

From a technical point of view, this website is supported by GitHub Pages using Jekyll. Starting from the Swiss Jekyll Theme by <a href="https://github.com/broccolini/swiss" target="_blank">broccolini</a>, I customized the look and feel of the website to make navigation a reactive and pleasing experience. The fonts are gathered through the Google Fonts API to ensure optimized requests.
