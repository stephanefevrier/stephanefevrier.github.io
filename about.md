# The website

Made to showcase some interesting projects, this website can be seen as a technical and scientific demonstrator. The objective is to produce engaging and user-friendly data visualizations, along with the ability to play with model's parameters and directly see the effects on the predictions.

From a technical point of view, this website is supported by GitHub Pages using Jekyll. Starting from the Swiss Jekyll Theme by <a href="https://github.com/broccolini/swiss" target="_blank">broccolini</a>, I customized the look and feel of the website to make navigation a reactive and pleasing experience. The fonts are gathered through the Google Fonts API to ensure optimized requests.
